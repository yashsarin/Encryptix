TIC-TAC-TOE :
Introduction:
This project is a Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python using Pygame. It includes an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to make decisions. The game allows for a single-player experience where the player competes against the AI.

Features
Single-player mode: Play against an AI opponent.
Minimax Algorithm: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the best move.
Graphical Interface: The game has a simple and clean graphical interface built with Pygame.

This project allows me:
1. Understanding game theory.
2. Basic search algorithms
